# Rotation-Based Fasciculation Analysis Using Optical Flow

A research-oriented computer vision framework for analyzing rotational motion patterns in synthetic fasciculation simulations using dense optical flow and multi-scale region-based motion estimation.

The project focuses on detecting and quantifying localized rotational dynamics from biomedical-inspired synthetic motion videos. Dense optical flow is computed using the Farneback algorithm, followed by rotational field estimation across multiple rectangular regions of interest (ROIs). The framework supports motion normalization, temporal smoothing, visualization, and CSV-based quantitative analysis.
